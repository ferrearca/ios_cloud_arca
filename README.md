# Introduction

When integrating an enterprise data set, the team at Ferre Arca will provide you with a transition toolset or startup tool set to provide secure communication with stored data. The transport of data will be secured using a custom E2E encryption system. This protected library will provide a one way encryption pipeline to get your data into the cloud where it cannot be tampered with.

API integration is simple, we provide a wrapper for your cloud provider of choice, to push through data into the cloud storage space encrypted, where it cannot be accssed for viewing. Only the source of the data, your end user, will have access to the decrypted information. You can upload any datatypes and formats as supported by the cloud provider.

Analytics are done in an anonymised fashion on the user device. Analytics are then pushed up into your platform of choice where you can perform the detailed analysis of the data which you need.
